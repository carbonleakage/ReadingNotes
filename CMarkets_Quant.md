# Complete Guide to Capital Markets

## Financial Markets

At any given time, there are people and organisations that want money (example: construct a highway, open a new factory etc) and there are people and organisations that have money and want to invest it (example: family saving for retirement, insurance company with premiums, social security fund etc). 
The first group is willing to and able to pay the second group for the use of its capital. But how do they find each other, this is where the Financial markets come in.
